My Name is Chris Atwood. I have completed the data science bootcamp program at Springboard - The University of North Florida. I have created this giuthub repository to keep all the projects that I complete in my coursework. Thank you for taking a look.



Libraries:
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodel, scipy, PyTorch, Tweepy, Requests, json, BeautifulSoup, NLT



Projects involved
API mini project - Used Quandl API to create developer API credentials to build a json file and further, performed computations in order to determine stock prices and trading volumes.

Case Studies involved
London housing Case Study - Used pandas librarires and functions to see the trend of housing market in London metropolitan areas.

SQL Country Club case study - Used SQL intermediate concepts like joins, case statements, sub queries, windows functions etc. to solve different questions asked as a part of the project.

Frequentist Case Study - Apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data and has concepts like Central Limit theorem, bootstrapping and Hypothesis testing.

Integrating with Apps Case Study (Preview of what to expect in ML modeling)

Sourcing and loading data
Cleaning, transforming and visualizing data
Modeling
Hypothesis formulation
Getting distribution of data
Permutation test
Evaluating models
Calculating distances - Case Study

Euclidean distance
Manhattan distance
Cosine similarity calculations - Case Study

To measure distance, similarity measurements w.r.t orientation rather than magnitude
Regression Models - Case Studies

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Classification Models - Case Studies

KMeans algorithm
Decision Tree classifier model
Random Forest ensemble model
Gradient Boosting model
Grid search in KNN
